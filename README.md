# 👀 README 👀

`bonAPIty` is a python3 package allowing you to create simple API (GET) for your functions without writing any complicated line of server code and it is even simpler than Flask !  

You are the 👨‍🍳, just do what you do the best: cook code ! Do not lose your time to 💁, we do it for you :).  

By type hinting your code we cast the received inputs to the right type, so do not worry about it 😀.

## Install

> "See, unlike most hackers, I get little joy out of figuring out how to install the latest toy."
>
> -- <cite>Jamie Zawinski</cite>

Install it with `pip3 install bonapity` and take a look at `examples/` !

## Current support

Your API is REST compliant (accept the following verbs : `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) !

For each function, your API will return your computation as a JSON object if your return type is JSON serializable, or in the pickle format otherwise. For example, numpy.ndarray objects are not JSON serializable and will be returned as a binary pickle dump.

If you want to learn more about how it's working, take a loot to the "_How To_" section.

### Writting your first API

```python
from bonapity import bonapity

@bonapity
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Add two numbers. """
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bonapity.serve(port=8888)
```

### Requesting your first API

Testing REST verbs requests with `curl` :

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8888/add?a=1&b=3"
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8888/add?a=1&b=3"
curl --data '{"a": 1, "b": 3}' -X POST   "http://localhost:8888/add" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
curl --data '{"a": 1, "b": 3}' -X PATCH  "http://localhost:8888/add" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
curl --data '{"a": 1, "b": 3}' -X PUT    "http://localhost:8888/add" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Looking your fist generated API function documentation

Generated documentation for your first function is available at this url : `http://localhost:8888/help/add`.

### More Examples

For more examples with explanations take a look to the `examples/` dir.  
Recommended order for reading :

- How to import the decorator, use it and serve : `simplest.py`.
- Having a simple web interface using your simplest.py API : `simplest.html`.
- Using your API from a python client : `np_server_api.py`, `np_client_api.py`.
- Send/receive complex non python generic data types (such as np.ndarray) with a python client : `python_server.py`, `python_client.py`.

## How To

> "I am not accustomed to protocol."
>
> -- <cite>Evo Morales</cite>

We currently support 2 kinds of requests : `GET`, `DELETE` vs. `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`.
Each of them accept 2 different ways to get your data/parameters sent from the client to the your API.

But remember, we process those encoded data and present them to your code as if
they were not received from a complex protocol, everything is transparent for you !

You don't need to read this section for a quick start, just use the generated
wrappers in the generated documentation of your API (run the server and go to `/help/`), read this only if you want to get your hands dirty and not use the
generated wrapper but write your one instead.

### GET, DELETE

- **query string** : `/myfun?param1=value1&param2=value2`.  
   Each value can be formatted in JSON or a python string (eg. `v=True`is python but will be interpreted as the boolean `True` as if `v=true` which is the JSON encoding). Note that if your value is a string, it should be surrounded by `"`.
- **pass pickle object** : `/myfun?MY_BASE64_ENCODED_DATA`. 
   You can pass complex non JSON serializable python type by encoding in base64 the binary pickle dump representation of your data.  
   Here the encoded data should be a key/value dictionary where keys correspond to the parameters name of your function and values are... well your values.  
   This argument SHOULD NOT have a value !  
   For example, the equivalent of `/myfun?v=23` would be `/myfun?gAN9cQBYAQAAAHZxAUsXcy4=` because `gAN9cQBYAQAAAHZxAUsXcy4=` the base64 of `\x80\x03}q\x00X\x01\x00\x00\x00vq\x01K\x17s.` which is the pickle dump of `{'v': 23}`.  
   Note that we use python3, do not encode in the python2 version of pickle.

### POST, PUT, PATCH

- **application/json** :
   The data received by the server will be parsed as a JSON file and interpreted as a key/value dictionary where keys correspond to your param names of your functions and values the corresponding values.  
   Here the encoded data should be a key/value dictionary where keys correspond to the parameters name of your function and values are... well your values.
- **application/python-pickle** :
   The data received should be a binary pickled object (do not encode it in base64 for example) which will be loaded by pickle (python3, be aware of your pickle encoder version).
- No other type of content is accepted (such as _application/x-www-form-urlencoded_), so, if you are using the `requests` module, be aware to not write `requests.post(url, data={...})` but `requests.post(url, json={...})` instead, or specifying the _Content-Type_ in the header.

## In Development

> "I'll probably will do it, maybe definitely"
>
> -- <cite>Donald J. Trump</cite>

- [x] `POST` support
- [x] returning serialized pickle dump if return type is not JSON serializable
- [x] allow to pass non generic python types such as `numpy.ndarrays` as parameter
- [x] add automatic wrapper code generation to include in doc (will make usage by clients even much simpler) (TODO: make a better python version not converting the args into kargs)
- [x] Handle the others commands of the REST API standard : `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`
- [x] make the server multi-threaded to be non blocking (non sequential, request after request)
- [x] allow to put time limit execution on function to not be f*** by infinite loop or just too long function coupled with stupid/poorly intensionned user (implemented now : same timeout for every function)
- [ ] add Session support
- [ ] generate wrappers of all the functions available in API into a served JavaScript file to just have to include the link
- [ ] same thing as previous one but with python
- [ ] refactorize code
